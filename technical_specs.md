Database Structure
Schema Design:

What are the main tables and their relationships (if any) in the database?
Are there any indexes already implemented to optimize lookup performance?
Should any additional indexing (e.g., on frequently queried columns) be introduced for this PoC?
API Access:

What APIs are exposed by the database? (e.g., REST, GraphQL)
What is the expected format of API responses (JSON, XML)?
Are there any rate limits or constraints on API usage?
Data Retrieval:

What filtering and sorting capabilities are supported by the APIs?
How will large result sets (e.g., thousands of rows) be handled? (e.g., pagination, batching)
Should the RAG (Red-Amber-Green) status be calculated in the database, API, or the chatbot logic?
Chatbot Development
Query Handling:

How will queries in natural language be mapped to database queries? (e.g., using LangChain, custom NLP model, or rule-based logic)
How will ambiguities in queries be handled? (e.g., "Find stock data for XYZ" – clarify timeframe if missing)
Should the chatbot be able to refine queries iteratively based on user responses?
RAG Status and Response:

What criteria determine the Red-Amber-Green status for a record?
Should the RAG status logic be configurable (e.g., based on thresholds)?
How should the chatbot format the response to highlight RAG status visually or textually?
Response Generation:

Will the responses be purely text-based, or should they include structured data (e.g., tables)?
How will the chatbot handle multi-step interactions if a query requires follow-up clarifications?
Deployment in Azure DevOps
Infrastructure Setup:

Will the database and chatbot application be hosted on Azure? If so, what services will be used? (e.g., Azure SQL, Azure App Service, Azure Functions)
How will the API endpoints of the SQL database be secured within the Azure environment?
Code and Pipeline Management:

How will Azure DevOps Pipelines be set up to automate testing, deployment, and monitoring?
What branching strategy will be used in Azure Repos? (e.g., GitFlow, trunk-based)
Scaling and Monitoring:

What is the expected load for this PoC, and should the infrastructure be scaled dynamically using Azure Scale Sets?
Which monitoring tools (e.g., Azure Monitor, Application Insights) will be integrated to track query performance and errors?
Cost Management:

What budget constraints exist for deploying the chatbot and database on Azure?
How will cost optimizations (e.g., reserved instances, usage caps) be implemented?
NLP and Model Integration
Natural Language Processing:

What NLP library or framework will be used for query understanding? (e.g., OpenAI GPT API, Hugging Face models)
Will a pre-trained model be sufficient, or is fine-tuning on the organization’s domain data required?
Latency Optimization:

Where will the NLP processing happen: locally, in Azure, or via an external API?
How will you ensure that NLP processing and database querying together meet the 60-second response time goal?
Security and Access Control
Internal Deployment:

Should the Azure environment be isolated in a virtual network for security?
What access controls will be set for Azure resources (e.g., Role-Based Access Control for team members)?
Data Security:

Even though it’s internal, will the data be encrypted at rest and in transit?
Are there any logging requirements to track user interactions while ensuring no sensitive data leaks?
Testing and Validation
Testing Scenarios:

What edge cases should be tested for natural language queries? (e.g., misspellings, vague terms)
How will the correctness of database responses be validated during testing?
Load Testing:

Should the PoC undergo load testing to evaluate response times under multiple simultaneous queries?
What tools will be used for load testing? (e.g., JMeter, Azure Load Testing)
User Feedback:

How will feedback from internal users be collected and incorporated into chatbot improvements?
Future Considerations
Extensibility:

Should the architecture be designed to add integration with other systems later (e.g., CRM, analytics tools)?
How will new query types or additional NLP capabilities be incorporated into the chatbot in the future?
Authentication:

What will be the simplest approach to add authentication for internal users if required later?
Should Azure AD be considered for seamless integration into the organization’s existing infrastructure?
