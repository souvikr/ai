To build a chatbot for managing a 15TB SQL database of financial instrument data, you need to carefully design your project. Here's a breakdown of questions you should consider before proceeding with the project proposal:

### **Understanding the Use Case**
1. **Purpose:** What specific tasks will the chatbot perform? (e.g., querying data, updating records, generating reports)
2. **Target Users:** Who will use the chatbot? (e.g., internal employees, clients, regulators)
3. **Usage Scenarios:** What are the common queries or actions expected from the chatbot?

### **Database and Data Considerations**
4. **Database Structure:** How is the data organized? (e.g., schema design, indexing, partitioning)
5. **Data Types:** What types of data are stored? (e.g., text, numerical, time-series)
6. **Data Sensitivity:** Are there any regulatory or compliance concerns related to data access or sharing?
7. **Performance Needs:** How quickly should the chatbot respond to user queries?
8. **Query Complexity:** What level of query complexity is expected? (e.g., simple lookups vs. complex joins and aggregations)

### **Technical Requirements**
9. **Integration:** Will the chatbot integrate with existing systems? (e.g., internal platforms, third-party tools)
10. **Scalability:** How will the system handle an increase in data size or user traffic?
11. **Concurrency:** What is the expected number of simultaneous users?
12. **APIs:** Does the database already expose APIs, or will custom APIs need to be developed?

### **Security and Compliance**
13. **Access Control:** How will user authentication and role-based access control be managed?
14. **Data Masking:** Should sensitive data be partially or fully masked for certain users?
15. **Auditing:** Is there a need to log chatbot interactions for compliance?

### **Chatbot Features**
16. **Functionality:** Should the bot only respond to queries, or also perform updates?
17. **Natural Language Understanding:** How conversational should the bot be? 
18. **Languages:** Does the bot need to support multiple languages?
19. **Interface:** Will the chatbot be deployed on WhatsApp, Slack, a web app, or other platforms?

### **Performance Metrics**
20. **Key Metrics:** What success criteria define the MVP's performance? (e.g., response time, query accuracy)

### **Development and Deployment**
21. **Development Stack:** What tools and frameworks will be used? (e.g., LangChain for LLMs, SQL APIs)
22. **Hosting:** Where will the chatbot and related services be hosted? (e.g., on-premises, cloud)
23. **Maintenance:** Who will maintain the chatbot and database post-deployment?

### **Stakeholder Involvement**
24. **Approval:** Which stakeholders need to sign off on the MVP?
25. **Feedback Loop:** How will feedback from users be incorporated during testing?

### **Budget and Timeline**
26. **Resources:** What resources (personnel, tools, hardware) are available for this project?
27. **Timeline:** What is the expected delivery time for the MVP?
